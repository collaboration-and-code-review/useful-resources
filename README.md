## Bash Commands

Earlier, I said that the ability to navigate via terminal would be helpful (example: know how to change directory). Here are a few very helpful commands.

Go to the home directory

```bash
$ cd
```

Change directory

```bash
$ cd <folder-name>
```

List the folders and files in a directory

```bash
$ ls
```

Move back a directory

```bash
$ cd ..
```


## Commands

Clone (or download) the repo you have write permission to using the repo URL (this repo will be your origin)

```bash
$ git clone <repo-url>
```

Example: clone (or download) an organizational repo (organizational repo will be "origin")

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<organization-name>/<repo-name>
```

Example: clone (or download) a user account repo (repo needs to have already been forked to user account, forked repo will be "origin")

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name>
```

Change directory into the folder of the repo you cloned. Folder name will be the repo name.

```bash
$ cd <repo-name>
```

Verify which branch you are checked out on (important if more than one branch); you will be checkout out on the default branch initially (in this case master, which is the norm)

```bash
$ git branch
```

Create and checkout (switch) to a feature branch, branching off of the branch you intend your changes to be merged into (note how the local files switch to the files of the branch you are checked out on, exactly the same at first, but if you make a change in a branch and then switch back and forth between branches, you can see the difference)

```bash
$ git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Make your change, then add, commit, create a message (if you don't use -m, a Vim editor will open and you will need to know how to exit)

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Your note"
```

Push the new branch to GitHub to your origin (by default, the origin is the repo you cloned from that you have write permission to); This can also be used to push additional commits

```bash
$ git push origin <branch-name>
```

There will now be a new branch in the repo that is your origin. The branch will not be affecting anything else. If you never did anything else with it, it would just exist there.


## Alternative Branch Commands

If not working from within the branch you are branching off of, need to specify which branch branching off of (remember, you are branching off the branch you intend your change to be merged into)

```bash
$ git checkout -b <branch-name> <branch-branching-off-of>
```

If the branch already exists, just switch to a branch

```bash
$ git checkout <branch-name>
```


<!--
Fetch updates from the shared repoitory to your local .git folder. Create a local branch and insert the contents of a remote-tracking branch into it. Merge the master branch into it to keep it up to date. (If the repo was cloned before the pull request)

```bash
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout -b <local-branch-name> origin/<branch-name>
$ git merge master
```

Push additional commits to organizational feature branch or pull request branch

```bash
$ git push origin <branch-name> 
```

Because it is outside of the origin, it is not fetched in updates. We need to fetch it by its URL. 

Create and checkout a new branch (in this case off of the master branch, but could be another). Pull the contents of the remote forked repo branch into it (could be as a feature branch or a pull request branch).

```bash
$ git checkout -b <local-branch-name> master
$ git pull https://github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name> <branch-name>
```

Push additional commits to forked repo feature branch or pull request branch (contributor needs to have given permission, and local branch name and remote branch name need to match)

```bash
$ git push https://github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name> <branch-name>
```

Push additional commits to forked repo feature branch or pull request branch, if local branch name is different than pull request branch name

```bash
$ git push https://github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name> <local-branch-name>:<remote-branch-name>
```
-->


## Adding an Upstream Remote and Syncing a Fork

<!--
If you are working from the "Fork and Pull" Model, you are fetching from the upstream.

You can name the additional remote something else, but upstream is the common convention.
-->

Add upstream remote repository that will be synced with the fork

```bash
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/upstream-username/original-repository.git
```

Upstream example (syncing a fork)

```bash
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout master
$ git merge upstream/master
```

Push the changes to your corresponding branch in the forked repository in GitHub

```bash
$ git push origin master
```

## Tidy Up

When the pull request is accepted, delete the branch. It's good practice to delete merged or stale branches.  

* Close pull request
* Revert pull request (hopefully not needed)
* Delete local and remote (in browser) feature branch

Delete a branch

```bash
$ git branch -d  <branch-name>
```

Force delete branch

```bash
$ git branch -D  <branch-name>
```

Delete remote branch

```bash
$ git push <remote-name> :<branch-name>
```
